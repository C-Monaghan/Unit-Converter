# Unit Converter

A simple unit converter for converting tempeature, weight and fluid. This is my first Kotlin project and I plan to update and 
improve the various features and UI more as I learn more about Kotlin. Currently, the UI is created using XML.

## Current Features
* Ability to convert Celcius <-> Fahrenheit, Grams <-> Cups, and Millilitres <-> Fluid Ounces.
* A round up switch to round the conversion to the nearest whole number

## Working on
* A more friendly UI
* Adding more conversion options
